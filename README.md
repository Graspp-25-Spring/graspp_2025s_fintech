# 🤔 Research Question (Tentative)
New: What is the impact of fixed broadband subscriptions on digital payment in ASEAN and South Asian countries?

Old: To what extent is having a digital presence linked with improvements in financial inclusion and outcomes among the agricultural poor?

-> Link to original research question brainstorming [(here)](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NucYbSjfVlvDEOBGqh_Ji_7gGyhjJVdJAMbRCjujQzY/edit?usp=sharing)

Empirical Model:

\log(\text{Food Supply})_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log(\text{Mobile Subscriptions})_{it} + \beta_2 X_{it} + \epsilon_{it}

# 💭 Hypotheses regarding the data
1.	Access to electricity, higher rates of fixed broadband and mobile cellular subscriptions correlate with higher use of financial services via traditional financial institutions (FI) and mobile money.
2.	Access to electricity, higher rates of fixed broadband and mobile cellular subscriptions correlate with higher fertilizer consumption and value-add for agriculture.
3.	Owning a mobile money account is not directly correlated to access to financial institutions. (In certain regions, e.g. Indonesia, this is the case—mobile money had much more penetration than banks.)
4.	Ownership of mobile money account and/or access to financial institutions are correlated with higher fertilizer consumption and value-add for agriculture. (Perhaps more importantly, we want to know by what degree this is true.)
5.	Access to financial institutions is higher among urban rather than rural populations (Perhaps more importantly, we want to know by what degree this is true.)
6.	Areas with higher population densities are likely to have higher access to financial services.
7.	Areas with higher population densities are likely to have higher fertilizer consumption and value-add for agriculture.
8.	GDP per capita (+), poverty headcount (-), higher life expectancy at birth (+), and population densities (+) are correlated with higher financial access. (in the direction indicated in parentheses)
9.	GDP per capita (+), poverty headcount (-), higher life expectancy at birth (+), and population densities (+) are correlated with higher fertilizer consumption and value-add for agriculture. (in the direction indicated in parentheses)
