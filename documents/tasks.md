we have to complete series of actions

1. agree on hypothesis(need discussion and consensus)
   - digital technology/infrastructure -> improve welfare of rural poor
   - but how?
   - pathway1: improve credit access through "online banking", "credit scoring system using web-based transaction record"
   - pathway2: reduce the risk of bunkrupcy by proper judgement of financial capacity
   - pathway3: improve farm productivity by enhancing farm inputs access through online market (ex. online phato diagnosys combined with recommendation of appropriate farm inputs)
   - pathway4: improve farm resilience by providing free technology service (online technology promotion)
2. data selection
   - data coverage: south Asia and southeast Asia
   - year coverage: 2011 to 2024
   - data existence: even there are dataset for certain indicator, it does not ensure that our target country have a data (chack for missing country in selected dataset)
   - does the data cover our hypothesis?: confirm our hypothesis and available indicators 
   - classify all data item into three category: "treatment", "outcome", "control"
3. data importation
   - jsut use technique learned in the class, or code generated by AI
   - iport/export dataset (convert data Frame/CSV)
4. data clean-up
   - filter column
   - filter row
   - rename column
5. data manipulation
   - set data keys on "country" and "year"
   - some calculation if required (ex. to acquire resilience of agriculture production, i have to calculate production variance for last 5 years)
6. data integration
   - use pd.merge to integrate multile dataFrame
7. data analysis
   - create descriptive stat for all the data
   - Y = alpha + beta * X + gamma * control + time-fixed effect + country-fixed effect
8. data visualization
